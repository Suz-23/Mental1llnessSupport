<h1 id="h1Title"> Connection Between All Mental Illness</h1>
<p id="Paragraph"> The connection between all is that they all do not get enough reconigtions, in many cases, these mental illneses are romantisied and said to be solved much more easliy then going to a theropy, taking pills, and more. These mental illnesses are also seen as an "excuse" to skip school days or classes. Symptoms of manny mental illnesses, suicidal thoughts or comments are also used regularly, for example people may say "I'm going to kill myself" or "If I do bad in this test I'm gonna commit suicide". Because of this, the collective struggles that people with mental illnesses are not getting enough reconigtions, some people take mental illnesses as a joke instead of acknowledging the fact that it is in fact a serious topic. And when these mental illnesses have less reconigtions, it could also lead to less treatments or support from others, even though support is the best way to help a person who is struggling with mental illnesses, as a friend, family, student, teachers and so on.  </p>

<h1 id="h1Title"> Collective Solutions</h1>
<p id="Paragraph">The collective solutions for the inequallities towards all mental illnesses, is educate people about mental illnesses more, by using social media, for example a social media campaign that educates, or raises awareness about mental illness. Or a special class, which focuses on mental illnesses. But also have an awareness that mental illnesses are a serious topic and not something that could easliy be gone, or treated. When our community has an understanding of the struggles that people with mental illnesses face, it will ultimately lead to a supportive, less isolated, comforting community for people with mental illnesses. In fact, according to National Allience on Mental Illness (NAMI) after schools educating and rising awareness about mental illnesses, less students reported to feel isolated in their community. Proving that by educating, or rising awareness, and showing support towards mental illness, more people feel apart of the community, instead of isolation. And since not getting the support people need or want is the inequality that the people with mental illness face, educating people is the best way to end this enquality.  </p>
