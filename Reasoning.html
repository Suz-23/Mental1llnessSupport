<p id="Paragraph"> The connection between all is that they all do not get enough reconigtions, in many cases, these mental illneses are romantisied and said to be solved much more easliy then going to a theropy, taking pills, and more. These mental illnesses are also seen as an "excuse" to skip school days or classes. Symptoms of manny mental illnesses, suicidal thoughts or comments are also used regularly, for example people may say "I'm going to kill myself" or "If I do bad in this test I'm gonna commit suicide". Because of this, the collective struggles that people with mental illnesses are not getting enough reconigtions, some people take mental illnesses as a joke instead of acknowledging the fact that it is in fact a serious topic. And when these mental illnesses have less reconigtions, it could also lead to less treatments or support from others, even though support is the best way to help a person who is struggling with mental illnesses, as a friend, family, student, teachers and so on.  </p>
