Which DABSA stated to reduce isolation that people with bipolar go through and far more support. Just like the world bipolar day, educating people about bipolar could lead to these stereotype that people with bipolar are just acting moody or emotional to change. It could lead more people to feel comfortable and ultimately asking help when they need it.  </p>
