<h1 id="h1Title"> Inequality That People with Depression Face</h1>
<p id="Paragraph"> Inequality that people with depression face is getting no acknowledgement about the difference between sadness and depression. Many people believe sadness and depression are the same, but this belief is harmful and incorrect. Sadness is a normal and temporary emotion of disadvantage, loss, despair, grief, helplessness, disappointment and sorrow. On the other hand, depression is a long term feeling of loss, despair, grief, helplessness, disappointment and sorrow . Sadness is not a mood disorder though depression is. Depression could lead to how people think, act and feel in a harmful way like suicidal thoughts, though sadness doesn't. However sadness could become depression, sadness is in fact one of the psychological symptoms of depression. Though it is not the same as depression. Because of this, many people treat depression as a non-harmful thing and can be "easily cured”. This leads to statements like “Just cheer up” or “Everyone gets sad,” which can make people with depression feel even more alone and feel unsupported. Without any treatment depression could lead to suicide, substance use, and or unstable physical health.</p>

But educating kids about the effects of depression, it could lead to people giving more support and help towards people with depression.</p>
