<h1 id="h1Title"> Inequallity That People With PTSD Face </h1>
<p id="Paragraph"> Inequality that people with PTSD face is romaticizing that PTSD occurs only to soliders, and not others. In many cases, people romantasize PTSD only occuring to soliders, according to the U.S Department of veteran Affairs it is stated that about 23% percent of veterans exprience PTSD at some point. Due to an understanding that “only soliders have PTSD” people with PTSD that are not veterans are treated without any support or even doubted and asked questions such as “you weren’t in a war, do you actually have PTSD?” which could lead to people with PTSD to feel invalidated and isolated.</p>

<h1 id="h1Title"> Solutions to Inequallity Towards People with PTSD</h1>
<p id="Paragraph"> The solution to these inequalities is to educate people about PTSD in-depth. By doing this, the stereotype that PTSD not only occurs to veterans will be understood. Educating others about PTSD could help the person with PTSD, instead of ealier diagnosis. Some ways of in-depth education could be  a lesson dedicated to PTSD, and its causes and effects on a person. Or a social media campegin where it raises money for people with PTSD but also explaining what PTSD and how PTSD is formed.
